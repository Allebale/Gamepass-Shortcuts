# WIP-Gamepass-Shortcuts 
Links to use for game launchers like Launchbox or Kodi

MOST OF THE SHORTCUTS ARE NOT WORKING - and that is by design. 
Although i am working on fixing that.

So why use this now, you might ask?
You basically scan them to your library as a quick way to see what games there are on Game Pass.
Then when you want to play your game you install it through the Xbox-app and overwrite the game's shortcut.

There are currently 370 PC games (with some being collections) & 51 cloud exclusives.
If i have missed any please let me know.

If you use Kodi you will need this addon: https://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=287826
