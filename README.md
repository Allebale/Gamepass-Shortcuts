# Gamepass-Dummy-Shortcuts
Dummy files to use for game launchers like Launchbox or Kodi

THE SHORTCUTS ARE NOT WORKING - and that is by design. 
I might change that in the future, if i find an easy way that works.

So why use this then, you might ask?
You basically scan them to your library as a quick way to see what games there are on Game Pass.
Then when you want to play your game you install it through the Xbox-app and overwrite the game's shortcut.

There are currently 232 games as of this moment.
If i have missed any please let me know.
